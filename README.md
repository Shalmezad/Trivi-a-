<@sadpandashitposter> It should be a quiz thing

<@sadpandashitposter> Uh

<@sadpandashitposter> It should involve anime topics

Basic ideas:

>Node.js / Javascript

>Single player mode with a leaderboard to be created first; Mulitplayer/PvP may come later.

>Questions are divided into Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties.

        >4 options per question.
        
>10 questions per round.

        >4 easy, 4 medium, and 2 hard.
